## ABOUT ME
Hello! I am a Master's student in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington. I am looking for full-time opportunities starting May 2019. I have experiences of working in educational technology (K-20) and market research data but open to other domains like healthcare and life sciences. I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology Engineering from the University of Mumbai with a focus on Data Analytics and Neural Networks.
